- Hey, y'all! I’m Harvey, aka @harfeewastaken
- I have been trying to learn to code for years, but it never stuck. I have some ambitious goals in mind as of 2022. Too ambitious, maybe? You be the judge.
- Right now, I am learning Python because that seems to be where a lot of people start. Looking to get into API, JS, HTTP. 
- I’m hoping one day I can make something that makes someone's life easier. For now, I'm just looking to learn.

- If you need to reach me for whatever reason, you can email me: harveygit@pm.me
